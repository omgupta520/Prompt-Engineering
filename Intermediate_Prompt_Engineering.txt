Module 3: Intermediate Prompt Engineering

Deepen your prompting skills with advanced techniques that boost accuracy, reasoning, and safety. This module covers role prompting, content framing, multi-step reasoning, and debugging prompts.

1. Advanced Role Prompting

Role prompting sets the AI’s perspective, expertise level, and behavior.
It shapes how the model thinks before answering.

What it is:

Assigning a specific role to the model so that it responds with expertise, tone, and structure as required.

Examples

“You are a senior data scientist. Explain random forests to a beginner.”

“Act as an interviewer. Ask me 10 DSA questions.”

“Be my Spanish tutor. Talk to me in simple Spanish.”

Why it matters

✔ Creates context
✔ Improves response relevance
✔ Ensures consistency

2. Content Framing

You tell the model the angle or frame in which to think.

Frames you can use

Time frame → “Explain AI as if it's 2035.”

Audience frame → “Explain DBMS to a school student.”

Persona frame → “Describe the internet like a poet.”

Goal frame → “Explain PCA focusing only on intuition, not math.”

Example

Prompt:
“Explain blockchain from the perspective of a bank manager who is worried about security.”

3. Knowledge Prompting

Providing relevant facts, definitions, or constraints inside the prompt so the model reasons using your supplied data.

When to use

When you want precise answers

When the topic is technical

When hallucinations must be avoided

Example

Prompt:
“Here are facts about my project:
• It uses OpenCV for text extraction
• It detects handwriting from videos
• It converts frames into PDFs
Using this, generate a project abstract.”

4. Multi-Step Reasoning Prompts

Break a complex task into steps so the model reasons in stages.

Template
Understand the problem
Break into steps
Solve step-by-step
Combine results

Example

“Explain how a CNN works. First list the components, then explain each part, then give an example, then summarize in 5 points.”

Why it's powerful

✔ Forces logical structure
✔ Reduces errors
✔ Produces teachable explanations

5. Self-Consistency Prompts

AI generates multiple reasoning paths → chooses the most consistent answer.

Prompt Style

“Give 3 different ways to approach the problem, then choose the most reliable solution.”

Example

“Explain how to optimize a SQL query. Provide 3 approaches and pick the best one.”

This reduces hallucinations and improves reasoning quality.

6. Rewriting / Refactoring Prompts

Tell the AI to transform an existing text without changing its meaning.

Common use-cases
Make text formal
Simplify content
Convert bullet points to paragraphs
Improve clarity
Optimize code logic

Examples

“Rewrite this to be more polite.”

“Refactor the given Python code for better performance.”

7. Prompt Debugging & Troubleshooting

Fixing prompts that produce wrong or incomplete results.

Common Issues
Problem	Reason	Fix
Hallucinations	vague prompt	add constraints + knowledge
Too long/short	no format specified	specify structure
Wrong tone	no tone instructions	set audience + tone
Missing details	ambiguous ask	use checklist prompts
Debugging Example

Faulty prompt: “Explain ML.”
Improved:
“Explain machine learning in 5 bullet points with real-world examples for beginners.”

8. Writing Safe Prompts

Ensure the model avoids harmful output.
How to write safe prompts
Avoid asking for unethical actions
Provide safety rules in the prompt
Set boundaries explicitly

Example

“You are a responsible AI. Provide information about cybersecurity, but do NOT give any illegal hacking steps.”

9. Avoiding Hallucinations

Hallucinations happen when the model “fills in” missing information.

Techniques to reduce them

✔ Provide all required information
✔ Ask the model to verify facts
✔ Use citations or “If you don’t know, say you don’t know”
✔ Use structured prompts

Example Prompt

“If the answer is unknown, respond with: ‘Insufficient data to answer.’ Don’t assume anything.”
