Module 5: Prompting for Coding & Debugging
🎯 Module Objective

By the end of this module, learners will be able to:

Use AI effectively to understand, write, debug, and optimize code

Convert logic → clean code

Write secure, scalable, and optimized solutions

Think at architecture level, not just syntax level

1️⃣ Prompts for Explaining Code  
📌 Why this matters

Developers often read unfamiliar code:

Legacy code

Open-source repositories

Interview problems

Production bugs

AI can act as a code reviewer + tutor.

🔹 Basic Explanation Prompts
Explain this code line by line.

Explain this code in simple terms for a beginner.

Explain this code assuming I know DSA but not this language.

🔹 Advanced Explanation Prompts
Explain the time and space complexity of this code.

What edge cases does this code handle or miss?

Refactor this code and explain the improvements.

🔹 Teaching Tip

👉 Encourage learners to paste code + add context (language, level, goal).

2️⃣ Prompts for Generating Code
📌 Why this matters

AI is powerful only when the requirements are clear.

🔹 Poor Prompt ❌
Write code for login system

🔹 Good Prompt ✅
Write a login system in Java using Spring Boot.
Requirements:
- JWT authentication
- Password hashing
- Role-based access
- MySQL database

🔹 Common Code Generation Prompts
Generate a clean and optimized solution for this problem.

Write production-ready code with proper error handling.

Write code following industry best practices.

Generate unit tests for this function.

🔹 Constraint-based Prompting
Solve this problem in O(n) time and O(1) space.

3️⃣ Prompts for Debugging Code
📌 Why this matters

Debugging takes 30–50% of real dev time.

🔹 Basic Debugging Prompts
Find the bug in this code.

Why is this code giving wrong output?

Why am I getting this runtime error?

🔹 Advanced Debugging Prompts
Explain why this solution fails for edge cases.

Debug this code without changing its structure.

Compare my solution with an optimal one and point out mistakes.

🔹 Stack Trace Prompting
Here is the error message and stack trace.
Explain the root cause and fix it.

4️⃣ Prompts for Converting Logic to Code
📌 Why this matters

Many learners know logic but struggle with implementation.

🔹 Logic → Code Prompts
Convert this algorithm into C++ code.

Convert this pseudocode into Python.

Translate this flowchart into Java code.

🔹 Step-by-Step Prompting
First explain the approach, then write the code.

Break the solution into functions and then implement them.

🔹 Interview-Focused Prompt
Write interview-ready code with comments and dry run.

5️⃣ Secure Coding Prompts
📌 Why this matters

Security issues = real-world failures
AI can help identify vulnerabilities early.

🔹 Secure Coding Prompts
Review this code for security vulnerabilities.

Is this code vulnerable to SQL Injection or XSS?

Rewrite this code following secure coding practices.

Add input validation and sanitization.

🔹 Security-Specific Use Cases
Secure this REST API.

Implement password hashing and salting.

Prevent race conditions in this code.

6️⃣ Architecture-Level Prompting
📌 Why this matters

Senior engineers think in:

Components

Scalability

Fault tolerance

Design patterns

🔹 Architecture Design Prompts
Design a scalable architecture for an e-commerce application.

Suggest system architecture for 1M concurrent users.

Design this system using microservices.

🔹 Comparison Prompts
Compare monolithic vs microservices for this use case.

Which design pattern fits this problem and why?

🔹 Real-World Prompt
Design this system assuming AWS cloud deployment.

7️⃣ Improving Time & Space Complexity Using Prompts
📌 Why this matters

Optimization separates good devs from great devs.

🔹 Optimization Prompts
Optimize this solution for time complexity.

Reduce space complexity without changing logic.

Is there a better algorithm for this problem?

🔹 Comparative Prompting
Compare brute force vs optimized approach.

Explain why this solution is better than mine.

🔹 Interview-Oriented Prompt
Optimize this code to pass large input constraints.

8️⃣ Best Practices for Prompting (Golden Rules)
✅ Be specific

Bad:

Fix this code


Good:

Fix this code for runtime error and optimize it for O(n).

✅ Add constraints

Language

Complexity

Style

Use case (interview / production)

✅ Ask for explanations
Explain why this approach works.

9️⃣ Hands-on Exercises (For Students)

Explain given LeetCode solution using AI

Generate optimized code from brute force

Debug intentionally broken code

Convert algorithm → implementation

Improve time complexity using AI prompts

Review code for security flaws
