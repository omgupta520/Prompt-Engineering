Practice Exercises for Prompting Foundations

Exercise Set 1: Clear vs Vague Instructions----------------------------------

1. Rewrite the following vague prompts into clear prompts:

“Tell me about AI.”

“Explain Python.”

“Write a paragraph about internet.”

“Teach me coding.”

“Explain ML algorithm.”

Your task:

Rewrite each into a clear, specific, structured prompt with constraints (tone, format, output length).

Exercise Set 2: Role Prompting------------------------------------------------
Assign the right role to improve the response quality.

Convert the following instructions into role-based prompts:

“Fix my JavaScript code.”

“Explain this math problem.”

“Make my resume better.”

“Prepare me for an interview.”

“Explain this DSA concept.”

Goal:

Add an appropriate role like “You are a senior JavaScript developer”, etc.

Exercise Set 3: Task Decomposition---------------------------------------
Break these tasks into 4–6 smaller steps:

“Build a weather forecast app.”

“Create a personal portfolio website.”

“Make a chatbot using Python.”

“Explain how to start a YouTube channel.”

“Develop a basic calculator app.”

Exercise Set 4: Chain-of-Thought------------------------------------------
Ask the AI to show step-by-step reasoning for the following problems:

“A car travels 540 km in 6 hours. Find speed.”

“Find LCM of 12 and 18.”

“You buy a phone for ₹20,000 and sell at ₹25,000. Find profit %.”

“In an exam, you scored 45 out of 60. Find percentage.”

“Solve: 18 + (6 × 5) – 12.”

Exercise Set 5: Few-Shot Prompting------------------------------------------

Provide two examples and then ask the model to continue the pattern.

Try these tasks:

Convert rude → polite messages

Convert long sentences → short summaries

Classify sentences as spam or not spam

Convert English → Hinglish

Rewrite in formal tone → informal tone

Example task:
Provide 2 polite conversion examples and ask the AI to convert a new sentence.

Exercise Set 6: Zero-Shot Prompting---------------------------------------------

Use zero-shot prompting for:

Sentiment classification

Summarization

Language translation

Tagging keywords

Explaining a concept

Example:
“Summarize this text in one sentence: (add any short paragraph).”

Exercise Set 7: Constraints Practice-----------------------------------------

Add constraints (tone, format, word limit, rules) to these tasks:

“Explain cloud computing.”

“Write a short bio for Instagram.”

“Describe blockchain.”

“Explain OOP.”

“Create a to-do list app idea.”

Example:
“Explain cloud computing in 5 bullet points under 60 words using beginner-friendly tone.”

Real-Life Examples of Prompt Engineering---------------------------------------

These examples show how prompts are used in actual jobs, especially in tech careers you’re pursuing (AI/ML, development, data analysis).

1. Software Development
Task: Debugging

Prompt:
“You are a senior Python developer.
Find the bug in this code and explain the fix in 3 points.
Code: (paste code)”

Why it works: Clear role + clear expectation.
2. Resume/CV Building

Prompt:
“You are a professional resume writer.
Rewrite the following experience in strong action verbs and ATS keywords. Keep it within 3 bullet points.”

3. Learning New Concepts

Prompt:
“You are a math tutor.
Explain gradient descent with an analogy and a simple graph explanation.
Use a friendly tone.”

4. Data Analysis

Prompt:
“You are a data analyst.
Summarize insights from this CSV in bullet points.
Focus on trends and anomalies.”

5. AI/ML Model Explanation

Prompt:
“Explain Random Forest like I am 16 years old.
Use 5 bullet points and one real-life example (like fraud detection).”

6. Customer Support

Prompt:
“You are a polite customer support agent.
Write a response to a customer who is angry because their order is late.”

7. Email Writing

Prompt:
“You are a formal email assistant.
Write a professional email to HR asking for correction in salary slip.”

8. Marketing & Content Writing

Prompt:
“You are a digital marketer.
Write an Instagram caption for a tech reel in a funny tone.
Limit: 20–25 words.”

9. Coding Help (Your projects: OCR / DSA)

Prompt:
“You are a computer vision expert.
Explain how to detect handwritten text in video frames and convert to PDF.
Break it into clear steps.”

10. Interview Preparation (Your Sparks 18 interview)

Prompt:
“You are an interviewer for Next Gen Software Engineer role.
Ask me 5 DSA and 5 ML questions.”
