Practice Set 1: Apply Each Technique--------------

1. Advanced Role Prompting

Task:
Create a prompt that makes the AI act as a university professor teaching gradient descent to first-year students.

2. Content Framing

Task:
Write a prompt that asks the AI to explain cloud computing
—but framed as if it's being explained to a shopkeeper with no tech background.

3. Knowledge Prompting

Given the facts:

Model: YOLOv8

Task: Whiteboard marker detection

Output: Extract words and create a PDF

Task:
Create a prompt that uses these facts properly to ask the AI for a project introduction.

4. Multi-step Reasoning Prompt

Task:
Write a prompt that forces AI to:

Identify causes of overfitting

Explain solutions

Give an example

Summarize in 5 lines

5. Self-Consistency Prompt

Task:
Create a prompt where the AI must generate 3 different approaches to optimize SQL queries and then select the best one.

6. Rewriting / Refactoring Prompt

Task:
Write a prompt that asks the AI to rewrite a technical paragraph into a simpler version for a school student.

7. Prompt Debugging

Fix this vague prompt:
“Explain AI clearly.”

Rewrite it into a detailed, structured, non-hallucinating prompt.

8. Safe Prompt Writing

Write a prompt that asks about cybersecurity basics while explicitly preventing illegal hacking information.

9. Hallucination Avoidance

Write a prompt that includes:

“Answer only using known facts.”

“Say ‘I don’t know’ if unsure.”
