🧩 Solving Practice Set 1

Focus: Code Understanding • Generation • Debugging • Logic → Code

🔹 Question 1: Code Explanation (Understanding Code)
Given Code (Python)
def count_even(nums):
    count = 0
    for n in nums:
        if n % 2 == 0:
            count += 1
    return count

Student Task:

Use AI and solve the following:

Explain the code line by line.

Explain it for a beginner.

Find time and space complexity.

Mention edge cases this code handles or misses.

Refactor the code and explain improvements.

📌 Skills Tested:
Prompting for explanation + optimization thinking

🔹 Question 2: Code Generation (Good Prompting)
Problem:

Check whether a string is an anagram of another string.

Student Task:

Write a proper AI prompt including:

Language: Python

Constraints

Case-insensitive comparison

Ignore spaces

Generate the solution using AI.

Explain why the approach works.

📌 Skills Tested:
Requirement-based prompting + explanation

🔹 Question 3: Debugging Code (Logical Error)
Given Code (C)
int factorial(int n) {
    int fact = 0;
    for(int i = 1; i <= n; i++) {
        fact = fact * i;
    }
    return fact;
}

Student Task:

Find the bug using AI.

Explain why the output is always 0.

Fix the code without changing structure.

Add input validation.

📌 Skills Tested:
Debugging + reasoning + AI explanation

🔹 Question 4: Logic → Code Conversion
Given Logic:

Take an integer input.
If the number is negative, print “Invalid”.
If it is even, print “Even”.
Otherwise, print “Odd”.

Student Task:

Ask AI to first explain the logic.

Convert logic into Java code.

Add comments and dry run.

Make it interview-ready.

📌 Skills Tested:
Logic → Code + structured prompting

🔹 Question 5: Optimization (Time Complexity)
Given Code (Brute Force)
def pair_sum(nums, target):
    for i in range(len(nums)):
        for j in range(i+1, len(nums)):
            if nums[i] + nums[j] == target:
                return True
    return False

Student Task:

Optimize the solution using AI.

Reduce time complexity.

Compare brute force vs optimized approach.

Explain why optimized solution is better.

📌 Skills Tested:
Optimization + comparative prompting
