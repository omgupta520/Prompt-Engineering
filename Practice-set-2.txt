🚀 Solving Practice Set 2

Focus: Security • Architecture • Performance • Real-World Thinking

🔹 Question 1: Secure Coding Review
Given Code (Python)
query = "SELECT * FROM users WHERE email = '" + email + "'"
cursor.execute(query)

Student Task:

Ask AI to review this code for vulnerabilities.

Identify the security issue.

Rewrite code using secure practices.

Explain how the fix works.

📌 Skills Tested:
Security prompting + real-world awareness

🔹 Question 2: Debugging with Runtime Error
Given Error:
ZeroDivisionError: division by zero

Given Code:
a = int(input())
b = int(input())
print(a / b)

Student Task:

Explain root cause using AI.

Fix the code with proper error handling.

Add input validation.

Make it production-ready.

📌 Skills Tested:
Runtime debugging + defensive coding

🔹 Question 3: Convert Algorithm → Implementation
Given Pseudocode:
START
Input array
max = first element
FOR each element
   IF element > max
      max = element
PRINT max
END

Student Task:

Convert into C++ code.

Break solution into functions.

Handle empty array case.

Explain time complexity.

📌 Skills Tested:
Algorithm conversion + robustness

🔹 Question 4: Architecture-Level Problem
Problem:

Design a URL Shortener System (like Bitly).

Student Task:

Use AI to:

Design system architecture.

Identify components.

Handle scalability for millions of users.

Choose database and explain why.

📌 Skills Tested:
Architecture prompting + system design

🔹 Question 5: Performance Optimization (Interview Level)
Problem:

Find the second largest element in an array.

Student Task:

Write brute force solution.

Optimize to O(n) time and O(1) space.

Ask AI to explain optimized logic.

Write clean interview-ready code.

📌 Skills Tested:
Performance + interview readiness
