Practice Set 2: Realistic Scenario Tasks


1. Create a Role-Based Tutor Prompt

Make a prompt that turns the AI into an interviewer asking DSA coding questions at increasing difficulty levels.

2. Frame Content for a Specific Audience

Write a prompt to explain blockchain to your Spanish-speaking girlfriend, using simple English + small Spanish hints.

(Use your real-life context 😊)

3. Knowledge Prompting With Context

Use this info:

You are building an OCR + object detection whiteboard project

It extracts text from a live lecture

Converts output to PDF

Uses OpenCV + TensorFlow

Task:
Create a prompt that asks AI to generate a problem statement using ONLY these facts.

4. Multi-Step Analysis Prompt

Create a prompt where the AI must:

List types of neural networks

Explain each

Compare them

Give the best one for image classification

Justify the answer

5. Self-Consistency Reasoning Task

Write a prompt that asks the AI to:

Propose 3 ways to improve a student's ML study plan

Then choose the most realistic method

Then justify its selection

6. Refactoring Prompt

Give a prompt asking the AI to refactor a poorly written C code snippet for readability + performance.

7. Debug a Faulty Prompt

Fix this prompt:
“Tell me everything about machine learning.”

Rewrite a clear, structured, goal-specific version.

8. Write a Safe Prompt

Write a prompt that asks the AI to explain social engineering attacks but must not give actionable harmful steps.

9. Hallucination-Control Prompt

Write a prompt where the AI must answer using ONLY verified information and include:
“If any detail is uncertain, respond with: ‘Not enough data.’”
