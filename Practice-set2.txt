⭐ Practice Set 2 — Real-World Scenario Tasks

These tasks combine multiple expert prompt patterns in real practical use-cases.

1. ReAct + Scratchpad

Write a prompt that forces the AI to analyze a student’s monthly expenses using Reason → Action → Observation, and perform all calculations in a scratchpad.

2. Tree-of-Thought for Career Planning

Write a ToT-style prompt that helps a student choose between:

Data Science

Cybersecurity

Full-Stack Development

AI must generate 3 branches, evaluate each, and choose the best based on criteria.

3. Graph Prompting for DBMS

Create a graph-prompt asking the AI to explain how transactions, locks, ACID properties, and concurrency control interact in DBMS.

4. Auto-Prompting for Project Idea

Ask AI to first generate the best prompt possible and then give you 5 innovative AI project ideas for ECE students.

5. Wizard-of-Thought for Coding Debugging

Write a wizard-style guided prompt where the AI must help a beginner debug this:

for(int i = 1; i <= 5; i++);
{
    cout << i;
}


AI must teach slowly with hints.

6. Schema-Driven Prompt for ML Concepts

Provide this schema:

{
  "name": "",
  "definition": "",
  "math_form": "",
  "use_cases": [],
  "pros": [],
  "cons": []
}


Create a prompt asking AI to fill it for “Softmax Regression.”

7. Meta Prompt for Safer Output

Write a meta prompt ensuring AI:

Avoids hallucinations

Says “Unknown” if unsure

Uses only verified facts

Does not add imaginary sources
Topic: “History of Deep Learning.”

8. Reflexion Prompting for Code Quality

Write a prompt where AI must:

Write Python code to reverse a linked list

Review its code

Improve it

Explain the improvements

9. Deliberate Prompting for Comparison

Write a prompt telling AI to think deeply and compare:
SVM vs Decision Tree vs Random Forest
→ List considerations
→ Analyze each
→ Give final conclusion

10. Mixed Pattern: (ToT + Meta + Schema)

Write a single prompt where AI must:

Follow a schema

Use tree-of-thought reasoning

Follow meta instructions (factual, step-by-step, no assumptions)
