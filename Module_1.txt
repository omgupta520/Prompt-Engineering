📘 Module 1: Introduction to Prompt Engineering (Detailed Explanation)

Module 1 builds the foundation. Students learn how LLMs think, how prompts are interpreted, and how to write clear instructions.

1️⃣ What is Prompt Engineering?
Definition:

Prompt Engineering is the process of designing clear, structured instructions that help AI models produce accurate, reliable, and high-quality outputs.

Why it matters

LLMs do not think like humans — they generate text based on patterns and probabilities.
Prompts act like instructions or programming commands for the model.

📌 Example (Bad vs Good Prompt)

❌ Bad Prompt:
Write something about AI.

✔️ Good Prompt:
Act as an AI professor. Explain Artificial Intelligence in 5 bullet points with simple language.

Result: Cleaner, accurate output.

2️⃣ Why Prompt Engineering Is a High-Income Skill?
Reasons:

1-AI is everywhere — businesses need people who know how to control it.

2-Companies lose money due to bad prompts, hallucinations, and poor automation.

3-Prompt Engineers are needed for:

AI automation
Product development
AI agents
Data analysis prompts
Code generation
SEO + marketing workflows
Customer support bots

Salary trends (2026):

US: $140k–$240k
India: ₹12 LPA – ₹45 LPA
Freelancing: $50–$150/hr

3️⃣ Types of AI Models
i. LLMs (Large Language Models)

Models that understand and generate text.

Examples:

GPT-4, GPT-5
Claude 3
Gemini
Llama 3

ii. Vision Models

Models that understand images + text.

Examples:

GPT-4V
Gemini Vision
Claude Vision

Use cases:

Image explanation
Diagram understanding
Code screenshot → code recreation

iii. Multi-Modal Models

Models that support text + image + audio + video.

Examples:

GPT-5 Omni
Gemini Ultra
Claude Opus Vision

Use cases:

Video analysis
Audio transcription
Image-to-code

Multi-modal agents

4️⃣ Understanding LLM Architecture — Basic Level

Students don’t need deep ML knowledge, but must know how LLMs think.

Key components:-

Tokens
Embeddings
Transformer architecture
Attention mechanism

📌 Basic Flow
User prompt → Tokenization → Embedding → Transformer Layers → Output tokens → Response

What is the Transformer?

An LLM architecture that uses attention to understand relationships between words.

What is Attention?

It determines which words matter most in the prompt.

Example:
In the sentence:
"The cat sat on the mat because it was tired."
The word “it” refers to cat, not mat.
Attention helps LLM understand this.

5️⃣ Tokens, Prompts & Parameters
i. Tokens

LLMs don’t read full words. They read tokens.

Example:
“ChatGPT is amazing” → might become → Chat, G, PT, is, amaz, ing

More tokens = more cost + more computation.

ii. Prompt

A prompt is the instruction you give to AI.

Types:

Question
Instruction
Task
Context

Example-based prompt

iii. Important Parameters

1. Temperature

Controls creativity.

Low (0–0.3): More logical
Medium (0.5–0.7): Balanced
High (0.8+): Creative, risky

2. Top-P

Controls randomness. Similar to temperature.

3. System Message

Defines AI's role, behavior, and boundaries.

Example:
You are a professional Python developer. Always give optimized code.

4. Max Tokens

Controls output length.

6️⃣ Prompt Formats

Understanding different prompt styles is critical.

i. Instruct Format

Direct instructions.

Example:
Explain quantum computing in simple words.

ii. Chat Format

Role + message.

Example:
System: You are a math tutor.
User: Explain Pythagoras theorem.

iii. Story Format

Used for fiction, imagination.

Example:
Write a sci-fi story where humans talk to LLMs.

iv. Code Format

Ask for coding output.

Example:

Write a Python script to extract emails from text.

v. Structured Format

JSON, tables, bullet lists.

Example:

Provide output in JSON:
{
 "summary": "",
 "keywords": []
}

7️⃣ Common Mistakes Beginners Make
1. Giving vague instructions

❌ “Write an email.”
✔️ “Write a formal email to HR asking for leave.”

2. Not specifying output format

❌ "Explain DBMS."
✔️ “Explain DBMS in 5 bullet points.”

3. Asking multiple tasks in one sentence

❌ “Explain AI, write a report, also give examples.”
✔️ Break it into steps.

4. No context

LLMs need context to avoid hallucination.

❌ “Write code.”
✔️ “Write C++ code to sort an array using quicksort.”

5. Not using constraints

LLMs overshoot when not controlled.
