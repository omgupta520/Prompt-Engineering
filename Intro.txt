📘 Module 7: Prompting for Data, ML & Analytics
🔹 1. Data Extraction Prompts
🎯 Goal:

Use prompts to extract structured data from:

Raw text

PDFs

Logs

Emails

Tables

Screenshots (OCR output)

🔹 What Students Should Learn

Converting unstructured text → structured format

Extracting specific fields

Cleaning messy text

Output formatting (JSON / CSV)

🔹 Example 1: Extract Structured Data
Input:
Name: Rahul Sharma  
Email: rahul@gmail.com  
Skills: Python, SQL, Machine Learning  
Experience: 2 years

Prompt:
Extract the following details in JSON format:
- Name
- Email
- Skills (as a list)
- Experience (in years)

Text:
<insert text>

Output:
{
  "Name": "Rahul Sharma",
  "Email": "rahul@gmail.com",
  "Skills": ["Python", "SQL", "Machine Learning"],
  "Experience": 2
}

🔹 Advanced Prompt (Production Level)
You are a data extraction assistant.
Extract structured information strictly in JSON format.
If any field is missing, return null.

Fields:
- Name
- Email
- Phone
- Skills
- Experience (numeric only)

Text:

🔹 2. CSV → Insights Prompts
🎯 Goal:

Upload CSV data and get:

Summary insights

Patterns

Business conclusions

🔹 Teaching Concept:

Instead of manually analyzing CSV, we prompt:

Analyze the dataset and provide:
1. Summary statistics
2. Key trends
3. Outliers
4. Business insights
5. Recommendations

🔹 Example Dataset:

Sales data with:

Date

Region

Revenue

Product

🔹 Sample Prompt:
You are a data analyst.
Analyze the following dataset and provide:

1. Total revenue
2. Best performing region
3. Monthly trend
4. Any anomalies
5. Strategic recommendations

Dataset:
<insert CSV>

🔹 3. Data Normalization Prompts
🎯 Goal:

Standardize messy data

Example problems:

Uppercase/lowercase mismatch

Different date formats

Mixed currency

Misspellings

🔹 Example Prompt:
Normalize the following dataset:

Rules:
- Convert all names to Title Case
- Standardize dates to YYYY-MM-DD
- Convert currency to INR
- Remove duplicates

Data:
<insert data>

🔹 Teaching Insight:

LLM helps in:

Data cleaning

Schema validation

Format enforcement

🔹 4. Prompting for EDA (Exploratory Data Analysis)
🎯 Goal:

Use prompts to:

Identify correlations

Detect missing values

Suggest visualizations

Highlight patterns

🔹 Example EDA Prompt:
You are a data scientist.
Perform exploratory data analysis on this dataset.

Include:
- Missing values analysis
- Distribution analysis
- Correlation insights
- Outlier detection
- Suggested visualizations
- Key observations

Dataset:

🔹 Advanced EDA Prompt
Act as a senior data scientist preparing for stakeholder presentation.
Focus on business insights, not just technical stats.
Highlight actionable insights.


👉 This teaches role-based prompting

🔹 5. ML Conceptual Prompting
🎯 Goal:

Use LLM to:

Choose model

Explain algorithms

Compare models

Debug ML logic

🔹 Example 1: Model Selection Prompt
I have a dataset with:
- 10,000 rows
- 20 features
- Target variable: binary (0/1)

Suggest:
1. Suitable ML algorithms
2. Why each is suitable
3. Pros & cons
4. Evaluation metrics

🔹 Example 2: Debug ML Pipeline
My accuracy is 98% but validation accuracy is 60%.
Explain possible reasons and how to fix it.


👉 Teaches:

Overfitting

Data leakage

Bias-variance tradeoff

🔹 6. Writing ML Reports Automatically
🎯 Goal:

Generate:

Project reports

Internship reports

Final year project documentation

Model evaluation summary

🔹 Prompt Template for ML Report
Generate a professional ML project report.

Project Title: Spam Email Classifier
Dataset: Kaggle Spam Dataset
Algorithms used: Naive Bayes, Logistic Regression
Accuracy: 94%

Include:
1. Introduction
2. Problem Statement
3. Dataset Description
4. Data Preprocessing
5. Model Building
6. Evaluation
7. Results
8. Conclusion
9. Future Scope

🔹 Advanced Version (Industry Style)
Write a detailed ML report suitable for submission in a corporate environment.
Use formal tone.
Include technical explanation and business impact.

🔹 7. Data Visualization Prompts
🎯 Goal:

Generate:

Python matplotlib code

Seaborn charts

Power BI visualization ideas

Dashboard suggestions

🔹 Example Prompt
Suggest suitable visualizations for:
- Sales by region
- Monthly revenue trend
- Customer segmentation
- Product performance

Explain why each chart is suitable.

🔹 Code Generation Prompt
Generate Python matplotlib code to:
1. Plot revenue trend
2. Show region-wise comparison using bar chart
3. Plot correlation heatmap

Do not use seaborn.
Use separate plots.


(Important in real projects)

🔥 BONUS: Prompt Framework for Data/ML

Teach this structure:

🔹 The D.A.T.A Framework

D – Define Role
“You are a senior data analyst…”

A – Assign Task
“Perform EDA and extract insights…”

T – Technical Constraints
“Return output in JSON…”

A – Actionable Output
“Provide business recommendations…”
