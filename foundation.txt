Module 2: Prompting Foundations (Teaching Material)

Master the core techniques that make prompts accurate, predictable, and powerful.
1. Rules of Effective Prompting
✔ 1. Be Clear, Not Clever

AI understands clarity more than creativity.

Bad Prompt:
“Tell me something about computers.”
Good Prompt:
“Explain how a CPU works in simple language (5–6 lines).”

✔ 2. Provide Context

Context = who you are, what you want, why you want it.

Example:
“You are a Python tutor. Teach me list comprehension with two examples.”

✔ 3. Define the Output Format

Tell the AI exactly what to return.

Examples:

“Give output in bullet points.”

“Return answer in a table.”

“Explain in 100 words.”

✔ 4. Provide Constraints

Limitations make outputs cleaner.

Examples:

“Explain in 2 steps.”

“Use only beginner-friendly terms.”

“Do not use equations.”

✔ 5. Avoid Ambiguity

Be specific with terms like “summarize”, “explain”, “analyze”.

Example:
Instead of: “Explain AI”
Say: “Explain Artificial Intelligence in simple terms for a beginner with 2 examples from daily life.”

2. Clear Instructions vs Vague Instructions
Vague Prompt Example

“Write something about machine learning.”

→ Output will be random and unfocused.

Clear Prompt Example

“Explain machine learning in simple language for a 12-year-old. Use 5 bullet points and give one real-life example like YouTube recommendations.”

→ Output becomes accurate, structured, and useful.

3. Role Prompting

AI performs better when you assign it a role.

Examples of Roles

“You are a senior Python developer.”

“You are a math tutor.”

“You are an interviewer for a software engineering role.”

“Act like a therapist who speaks politely.”

Example Prompt

“You are a DSA instructor. Teach me binary search using examples and code in C++.”

4. Task Decomposition

Break a complex task into smaller steps — AI performs each step better.

Example Problem:

“Explain how to build a weather app.”

Decomposed Prompt:

“Step 1: Introduce how weather APIs work.”

“Step 2: Explain how to fetch API data using Python.”

“Step 3: Show how to display results in a simple UI.”

“Step 4: Give the final combined code.”

This method increases accuracy and clarity.

5. Chain-of-Thought Basics

Chain-of-Thought = Asking the AI to show its reasoning step-by-step.

Example:

Prompt:
“Show step-by-step reasoning to solve: A train travels 300 km in 4 hours. What is the speed?”

Response:

Distance = 300 km

Time = 4 hr

Speed = Distance / Time = 300/4

Speed = 75 km/hr

→ Useful for math, logic, explanations, and teaching.

6. Few-Shot Prompting

Give examples so the AI understands the pattern.

Example:

“Convert sentences into polite versions.
Examples:

‘Send the file now.’ → ‘Could you please send the file when you get time?’

‘Fix this bug.’ → ‘Can you please look into this bug?’
Now convert:
‘Come to my office.’”

→ AI follows the style of your examples.

Use this for:
✔ Text conversion
✔ Style learning
✔ Pattern-based tasks
✔ Classification

7. Zero-Shot Prompting

Ask AI to do a task without examples.
Works well when the instruction is clear.

Example:

“Classify this sentence as positive, negative, or neutral:
‘I loved the new iPhone camera.’”

→ AI generates the answer without seeing samples.

Use for:
✔ Classification
✔ Summary
✔ Explanation
✔ Translation

8. Using Constraints (Tone, Format, Rules)
Tone Constraints

formal
friendly
aggressive
professional
humorous

Example:
“Explain cloud computing in a friendly tone.”

Format Constraints

bullets
table
paragraphs
code block
JSON

Example:
“Give me a comparison of C vs C++ in a 2-column table.”

Rule Constraints

Set limits the AI must follow.

Example:

“Explain AI in 5 bullet points.

Rules:

No technical jargon.
No examples from robotics.
Keep it under 80 words.”
Final Summary (What Students Learn)

By the end of Module 2, you will be able to:

✔ Write prompts that give accurate, clean outputs
✔ Use roles, format, and tone to guide the AI
✔ Break tasks into smaller logical steps
✔ Apply zero-shot and few-shot prompting
✔ Use constraints to control the model
✔ Practice chain-of-thought for deep understanding
