Module 4: Expert Prompt Patterns

These are advanced prompting frameworks designed to support complex reasoning, planning, multi-step logic, and structured output generation.
They are used in research, real-world AI engineering, and advanced LLM deployments.

1. ReAct Prompting (Reason + Act)
What it is

ReAct combines:

Reasoning (thinking steps, analysis)

Acting (performing tasks like searching, calculating, or choosing next steps)

Why it matters

✔ Helps LLMs think step-by-step
✔ Reduces hallucinations
✔ Works great for multi-hop reasoning, problem solving, and planning

Template
Thought: (explain reasoning)
Action: (choose an action - search, calculate, lookup)
Observation: (result of that action)
Final Answer:

Example

Task: Solve: "Tom has 20 apples, gives away 6. How many left?"

Thought: Tom starts with 20 apples and gives away 6.
Action: subtract(20, 6)
Observation: 14
Final Answer: Tom has 14 apples left.

2. Tree-of-Thought Prompting (ToT)
What it is

A way to make the AI think like a tree:

Each node = a thought

Multiple branches = different solutions

The best branch is selected

Why it matters

✔ Encourages exploration of multiple solutions
✔ Useful for puzzles, planning, coding, and creative tasks
✔ Improves quality and reliability of answers

Template
Generate 3 possible reasoning paths (branches).
Evaluate each path.
Choose the best path.
Give the final answer based on the best path.

Example

Solve: “Plan a 3-day trip to Goa under ₹15,000.”

The AI generates:

Branch 1: Budget travel

Branch 2: Mid-range plan

Branch 3: Luxury-lite plan
Then picks the best branch matching ₹15,000.

3. Graph Prompting
What it is

Think of knowledge as a graph: nodes (concepts) and edges (relationships).
You ask the AI to map, link, and reason using these structured connections.

Why it matters

✔ Great for complex topics (machine learning, biology, networking)
✔ Helps LLM avoid linear-thinking errors
✔ Builds structured understanding

Template
Identify key concepts as nodes.
List relationships as edges.
Explain how the nodes connect.
Use the graph to answer the question.

Example

Explain CNN using a graph:

Node: Filters → detects features

Node: Feature maps → generated by filters

Node: Pooling → reduces size

Then connect nodes to explain flow.

4. Auto-Prompting
What it is

You ask the AI to generate its own best prompt before answering.

Why it matters

✔ Allows the model to decide the most effective prompt
✔ Improves response quality
✔ Removes need for manual tuning

Template
Step 1: Generate the best possible prompt to answer the question.
Step 2: Use that prompt and answer.

Example

User: “Explain RNNs.”

AI:

First generates:
“Explain RNNs with diagrams, math intuition, real-world examples, and differences from LSTMs.”

Then answers.

5. Wizard-of-Thought (WoT) Prompting
What it is

The AI explains its reasoning as if guiding a student like a wizard:
step-by-step, with hints and teaching logic.

Why it matters

✔ Very effective for tutoring
✔ Makes difficult concepts understandable
✔ Great for debugging code or math problems

Template
Explain reasoning slowly as if teaching a beginner.
Reveal clues or hints at each step.
Walk through the solution like a guided wizard.

Example

“How does backpropagation work?”

WoT-style:
“First, imagine each neuron sending errors backward like ripples…”

6. Scratchpad Prompts
What it is

A temporary space where AI writes out:

intermediate steps

calculations

hidden reasoning

notes before answering

Why it matters

✔ Forces accurate multi-step calculations
✔ Good for math, logic puzzles, reasoning-heavy tasks

Template
Use a scratchpad to write intermediate reasoning.
Do not skip steps.
After completing the reasoning, provide the final answer.

Example

Solve: “What is 13 × 27?”
AI writes multiplication steps in scratchpad before giving the answer.

7. Schema-Driven Prompts
What it is

You provide a structure (schema) the model must follow.

Schemas can be:

JSON

Table

Checklist

Form

Bullet structure

Why it matters

✔ Produces predictable output
✔ Great for APIs, automation, data extraction
✔ Eliminates formatting errors

Template
Follow this schema:
{ 
  "definition": "",
  "steps": [],
  "example": "",
  "mistakes": []
}
Fill it for: Convolutional Neural Network.

8. Meta Prompting
What it is

A “prompt about prompting” — instructing the AI how to respond, think, behave, and structure answers.

Why it matters

✔ Controls tone, reasoning, logic
✔ Ensures consistent answer quality
✔ Used for creating LLM agents

Template
You are an expert AI. 
Think step-by-step, avoid assumptions, and stay factual.
If unsure, say "Not enough information".
Provide structured reasoning.


This meta-instruction controls the answer quality.

9. Reflexion Prompting
What it is

AI reviews its own output, checks for errors, and corrects itself.

Why it matters

✔ Reduces mistakes
✔ Improves reasoning
✔ Good for coding, math, reports

Template
Step 1: Produce the answer.
Step 2: Critically analyze your answer.
Step 3: Correct mistakes and give improved answer.

Example

Solve a coding task → the AI checks its initial output → fixes logic errors.

10. Deliberate Prompting
What it is

Explicitly asking the AI to think carefully and consider different aspects before producing a response.

Why it matters

✔ Great for high-accuracy tasks
✔ Good for essays, legal questions, ML explanations
✔ Encourages depth

Template
Think carefully.
List key considerations.
Analyze each one.
Then provide the final answer.
